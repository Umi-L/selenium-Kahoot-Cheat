# selenium-Kahoot-Cheat
A kahoot cheat using python and selenium.

Uses Chrome Webdriver, modify 'PATH = "C:\Program Files (x86)\chromedriver.exe"' to change directory. Chromedriver must match chrome version. I will not be updating it so it may break in the future, in that case feel free to fork the repo and update it.
